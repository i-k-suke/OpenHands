# Design Document: Slack-like Communication Feature

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for implementing a Slack-like communication feature within the OpenHands chat interface.

## 2. System Architecture
The system will consist of the following components:

*   **Frontend (React):** The user interface for sending and receiving messages, managing channels, and displaying notifications.
*   **Backend (Python):** The server-side logic for handling message processing, channel management, user authentication, and data storage.
*   **Database:** A database to store messages, channel information, and user data. (e.g., PostgreSQL)
*   **Notification Service:** A service for sending real-time notifications to users. (e.g., WebSockets)

## 3. Frontend Design
*   **Message Input:** A text input field for composing messages.
*   **Message Display:** A scrollable area for displaying messages in chronological order. Each message will include the sender's name and timestamp.
*   **Channel List:** A list of available channels or conversations.
*   **Notification Indicator:** A visual indicator to notify users of new messages.

## 4. Backend Design
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/messages`: For sending and retrieving messages.
    *   `/channels`: For creating and managing channels.
    *   `/users`: For user authentication and management.
*   **Message Handling:** The backend will receive messages from the frontend, store them in the database, and broadcast them to the appropriate channel.
*   **Channel Management:** The backend will handle the creation, deletion, and modification of channels.
*   **User Authentication:** The backend will authenticate users using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The authentication process will involve the following steps:
    1.  The user provides their username and password.
    2.  The backend verifies the user's credentials against the `Users` table in the database.
    3.  If the credentials are valid, the backend generates a JWT containing the user's ID and other relevant information.
    4.  The backend returns the JWT to the frontend.
    5.  The frontend stores the JWT in a secure location (e.g., local storage or a cookie).
    6.  For subsequent requests, the frontend includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
    7.  The backend verifies the JWT before processing the request.

## 5. Database Design
*   **Messages Table:**
    *   `id` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `channel_id` (INT, Foreign Key)
    *   `user_id` (INT, Foreign Key)
    *   `message` (TEXT)
    *   `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)
*   **Channels Table:**
    *   `id` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `name` (VARCHAR)
    *   `description` (TEXT)
*   **Users Table:**
    *   `id` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `username` (VARCHAR)
    *   `password` (VARCHAR)

## 6. Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, WebSockets (e.g., `websockets` or `socket.io`)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL

## 7. Open Issues
*   Specific implementation details for user authentication.
*   Choice of WebSocket library for real-time notifications.
*   Detailed API specifications.
